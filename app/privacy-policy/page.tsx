              <strong>Ad Choices</strong>
              <p>
                - You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based
                Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and
                Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for
                us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising
                Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral
                Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain
                choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of
                Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit{" "}

                </Link>{" "}
                for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for
                mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party
                ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network
                Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and
                your opt-out options for their members, see{" "}

                . Even if you choose to opt out of certain kinds of
                Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other
                types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members
                should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to
                you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted
                content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your
                browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these
                opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a
                different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based
                method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA
                browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.

              <p>
                - Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet
                domain and host names; protocol (IP) addresses; browser software
                and operating system types; clickstream patterns; the MAC
                address or other technical information from your mobile device;

                technologies; and dates and times that our Site and Services are
                accessed. An IP address is a number that is automatically
                assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. Web
                servers, the computers that “serve up” webpages, automatically
                identify your computer by its IP address. The Site and Services
                may also use technology called “tracer tags”. These may also be
                referred to as “Pixels”, “Clear GIFs” or “Web Beacons”. This
                technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on our
                Site and other ways you interact with our Site and Services,
                such as purchases made through the Site and Services. These
                tracer tags are used to help us to optimize and tailor our Site
                and Services for you and other users of our Site and Services.
                We may link the information we record using tracking
                technologies to Personal Information we collect.

              <strong>Do Not Track</strong>

                in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by
                websites and online services. At the present time, the World
